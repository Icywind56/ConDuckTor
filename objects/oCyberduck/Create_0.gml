//weapons kill cyberducks not vice versa
//clamp fix, including point in rect except top edge
//sword fix circle collision, right angle, //ds_list
//fix weird trajectories
//switching weapons destroys the other, arrow continues to fly when bow is put away, but is destroyed if not flying
//cyberducks move semi-randomly
//sword moves up/down randomly
//add comments, organize code
//gravity for cyberducks

//add weapons groups and tags weaponsDamage weaponsTools
//arrow trajectories weird in top corners, need to define min speed that stick to wall maybe
//animations problems, sword and bow cycle animation but look like they don't (set gamespeed to small fps to see easily)
//problem firing multiple arrows at once, original shot affected by most recent shots trajectory
